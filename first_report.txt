1.- You have (specify components):

	1.- The car
        Components:
		1.1 Full frame
		1.2 Battery
		1.3 Servo motor
		1.4 Thrust motor
		1.5 RC receiver	
		1.6 Cooling fan

	2.- Stereo cam
		Libraries

	3.- Linux System

	4.- Arduino UNO 



2.- Still missing

	2.1 The RF transmitter for the car
	2.2 Battery Charger


3.- What steps have been done

	3.1 Research on documentation with Alejandro XXXX (webpage)

	3.2 You did not use the linux system. 
		DECISION: use the RPi instead??? We have to verify wether the RPi can or cannot handle the computational cost of the stereo pair. If yes, we will use a RPi and get rid of the linux system. If NOT, we have to use the linux system.

	3.3 You installed the RPi system, including the OpenCV.

	3.4 You learnt about OpenCV for processing the images from the stereo cam and calculate the distance. 
		3.2.1 Find the libraries
		3.2.2 Calibrate de cam with checkered board with windows laptop. Missing to do this in the RPi.
		3.2.3 You did use the OpenCV function in Windows to measure the distance provided by the stereo pair. Needed some experimental setup description and results.
